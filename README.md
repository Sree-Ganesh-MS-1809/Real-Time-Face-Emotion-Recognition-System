# Real Time Face Emotion Recognition System
 The project implements a face emotion recognition system using convolutional neural networks and image processing techniques to classify emotions from facial expressions in both real-time video and static images. It leverages data augmentation for robust model training and employs Haar cascades for accurate face detection.
